To make the process easy we have divided settings under different tabs:

1. Rating Configuration Tab:
Rating Configuration Tab contains a list of entities available in the system. And here you can enable rating, factors mode (multiset rating mode) and most rated content mode.
This page shows you a list of all entities in a table and related options are in an individual row.

2. Rating Parameters Configuration Tab:
This tab is for Rating Parameters/multiset rating creation which can be assigned later to those posts/pages/comments where user has selected Rating Parameters mode enabled.

3. Analytics & Sharing Configuration Tab:
Analytics & Sharing Configuration tab has got some advance features which are:
* Select Theme:  You may select default rating images from predefined / existing rating images which also shows you a preview what a rating widget looks like.
* Stars Display Count: Number of images/stars you want a rating widget should have got, which will be common for every post type.
* Demographic mode: Rating details with regional information can be viewed once this option is set. To view information Rating widget should be assigned to a page region.
* Share Feature: This enables normal sharing of your content to facebook and twitter with a snippet of content and average rating information.
